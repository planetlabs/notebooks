    "# Crop Type Classification: CART L8 and PS\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is a continuation of [Crop Type Classification: CART\n",
    "](classify-cart.ipynb) in which we use Landsat 8 as well as the PS Orthotile to generate features for CART classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates the following:\n",
    "1. Finding a Landsat 8 scene that overlaps a PS Orthotile\n",
    "1. Resampling Landsat 8 bands to match a PS Orthotile\n",
    "1. Loading, visualizing, and using bitwise logic to convert a Landsat 8 QA band to a mask\n",
    "1. Training a CART classifier using a combination of features from the PS Orthotile and Landsat 8 scene\n",
    "1. Quantifying the performance of the classifier on the training data (upper limit of performance on a new dataset)\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable this notebook, a lot of functionality was copied from [Crop Type Classification: CART\n",
    "](classify-cart.ipynb).\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook only utilizes the train dataset and tests the classifier results on the train dataset again. Future improvements would include testing on the train dataset.\n",
