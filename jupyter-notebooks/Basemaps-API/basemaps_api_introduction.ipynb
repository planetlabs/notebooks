    "Using the Basemaps API\n",
    "====================\n",
    "\n",
    "The Basemaps API allows access to data and metadata for basemaps you have access to as well as searching for and downloading quad data.\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial will introduce key concepts such as the relationship between Series, Mosaics, and Quads.  Along the way, we'll construct a small python client that you can use to do things like download quads through time for an AOI and TOI.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dependencies\n",
    "--------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll only be using two non-stdlib python libraries, and both are very common dependencies.  We'll use `requests` and `urllib3`.  If you have `requests` installed, then you also have `urllib3` installed. If you don't, use `pip install requests` or similar approaches to install the `requests` library.\n",

    "Planet API Concepts\n",

None of these are specific to the basemaps API, but it's important to understand how to handle all of them in whatever language or environment you're using whenever you're working with any Planet API.\n",
    "\n",
    "First off, let's set up your API key and set up the `requests` library to pass it along and automatically retry some types of error codes.  Read the overview of API mechanics for any of Planet's APIs here to more fully understand what is being set up: https://developers.planet.com/docs/analytics/api-mechanics/"

The results from any search or listing response are paginated and return \"chunks\" of values rather than the entire set at once to reduce response time.  Therefore, for all Planet APIs, you need to handle pagination in the client code you write to interface with the APIs.  When results are paginated, there will be a `_next` URL inside the `_links` section of the response to retrieve the next chunk of results.\n",

    "Up until now, we've been doing a lot of rather suboptimal things like passing around a `session` object everywhere and relying on a lot of global variables from previous cells.  These get clunky quickly, and you can see how it would be more convienent to have a few classes that handle this state for us with convienent methods to do common tasks with the basemaps API.  Put another way, the examples shown so far aren't reusable.  It would be nice to have something a bit more reusable and cleaner.\n",

The same quad ID may be in a very different location for a different mosaic, as ID depends on the tiling system.
