## Cloud Native Geospatial

Planet is proud to be a pioneer in the adoption of a new philosophy of working with geospatial data and computing in the cloud, known as Cloud Native Geospatial.

At their core, Cloud Native Geospatial technologies hold the following assumptions:

* All data of interest to a user is in the cloud; and these datasets will be far bigger than one could possibly fit on a desktop computer â€” worldwide imagery archives, historical gps data for fleets of assets, multi-dimensional weather data, global basemap data, etc.
* Infinite computation capabilities are available to process massive amounts of data, and the algorithms powering the processing can be shared online and customized collaboratively.
* Queuing and notification systems are in place, so newly acquired data (from satellites, from ground surveying, etc) can automatically kick off additional data processing, run updates, or send messages out to users.
* Web tiled online maps are available to visualize any data (both source data and derived data in interim or final processing steps).

Here, you will find notebooks introducing you how to work with these CNG technologies.
