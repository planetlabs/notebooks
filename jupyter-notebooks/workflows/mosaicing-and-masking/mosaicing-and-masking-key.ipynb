Since we're only interested in PlanetScope data, and we're creating a visual - not analytic - product, we'll set the Source to `3-band PlanetScope Scene`.

All three scenes overlap slightly, and one scene touches only a small section at the bottom of the AOI. Still, taken together the images provide 100% coverage, so we'll go ahead and place an order for the Visual imagery products for these three scenes."
