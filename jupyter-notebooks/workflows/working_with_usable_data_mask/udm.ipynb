    "# Working with the Unusable Data Mask (UDM)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "The Unusable Data Mask (UDM) is provided with many Planet products. It provides pixel-by-pixel information on quality issues that may affect the usability of each pixel, depending on the application. Specifications for the UDM are given in the [Imagery Spec Sheet](https://assets.planet.com/docs/Planet_Combined_Imagery_Product_Specs_letter_screen.pdf) and the [UDM2 API documentation](https://developers.planet.com/docs/api/udm-2/).\n",
    "\n",
    "In 2018, Planet released a major overhaul with the launch of UDM2, now called the 'Usable Data Mask' (UDM2). The original UDM product is still available as part of UDM2 and is stored in the 8th channel of the data UDM2 data asset. This Notebook demonstrates how to access and work with the original UDM asset.\n",
    "\n",
    "The UDM is an 8-bit single-band image. Pixel quality issues are bit-encoded. For example, if Bit 0 is set to 1 for a pixel in the UDM, then the pixel is in an area that was not imaged by the spacecraft, and the pixel is 'blackfill'. If all bits are set to zero, there is no quality issue with the pixel. The full description of UDM bit meanings is given below.\n",
    "\n",
    "How we convert a UDM to a mask depends on which quality issues we are concerned about. If we require no quality issues, then we mask out all pixels that have a non-zero value (any bits set to 1). However, if we have our own cloud detection algorithm and do not want to exclude pixels that are suspected to be cloud covered, then we mask out all pixels that have bits other than Bit 1 (cloud-covered) set to 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we demonstrate downloading, visualizing, and converting the UDM to a binary mask. The UDM is basically a classified image, where the binary representation provides the bit-encoded quality information. Therefore, we visualize the UDM as such. Next we convert the UDM to a binary mask for use in masking the scene. We create two different masks: one where all pixels with quality concerns are masked and another where pixels with quality concerns in the NIR are not masked.\n",
    "\n",
    "### UDM Bit Description\n",
    "\n",
    "The UDM bit description is copied from the [Imagery Spec Sheet](https://assets.planet.com/docs/Planet_Combined_Imagery_Product_Specs_letter_screen.pdf) and given here for convenience in interpreting the UDM.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Bit 0: Identifies whether the area contains blackfill in all bands (this area was not imaged by the spacecraft). A value of “1” indicates blackfill.\n",
    "* Bit 1: Identifies whether the area is cloud covered. A value of “1” indicates cloud covered. Cloud detection is performed on a decimated version of the image (i.e. the browse image) and hence small clouds may be missed. Cloud areas are those that have pixel values in the assessed band (Red, NIR or Green) that are above a configurable threshold. This algorithm will:\n",
    "  Assess snow as cloud;\n",
    "  Assess cloud shadow as cloud free;\n",
    "  Assess haze as cloud free.\n",
    "* Bit 2: Identifies whether the area contains missing (lost during downlink) or suspect (contains downlink errors) data in the Blue band. A value of “1” indicates missing/suspect data. If the product does not include this band, the value is set to “0”.\n",
    "* Bit 3: Identifies whether the area contains missing (lost during downlink and hence blackfilled) or suspect (contains downlink errors) data in the Green band. A value of “1” indicates missing/suspect data. If the product does not include this band, the value is set to “0”.\n",
    "* Bit 4: Identifies whether the area contains missing (lost during downlink) or suspect (contains downlink errors) data in the Red band. A value of “1” indicates missing/suspect data. If the product does not include this band, the value is set to “0”.\n",
    "* Bit 5: Identifies whether the area contains missing (lost during downlink) or suspect (contains downlink errors) data in the Red Edge band. A value of “1” indicates missing/suspect data. If the product does not include this band, the value is set to “0”.\n",
    "* Bit 6: Identifies whether the area contains missing (lost during downlink) or suspect (contains downlink errors) data in the NIR band. A value of “1” indicates missing/suspect data. If the product does not include this band, the value is set to “0”.\n",
    "* Bit 7: Identifies whether the area contains missing (lost during downlink) or suspect (contains downlink errors) data in the Coastal Blue and/or Green I and/or Yellow Band. A value of “1” indicates missing/suspect data. If the product does not include this band, the value is set to “0.”"
