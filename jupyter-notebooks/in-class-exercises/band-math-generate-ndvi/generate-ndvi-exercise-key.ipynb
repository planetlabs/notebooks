    "Researchers often use a vegetation index called NDVI to measure the \"greenness\" or density of vegetation across a landscape. In addition to monitoring vegetation health, NDVI _(Normalized Difference Vegetation Index)_ can be used to track climate change, agricultural production, desertification, and land cover change. Developed by NASA scientist Compton Tucker in 1977, NDVI is derived from satellite imagery and compares reflected near-infrared light to reflected visible red light. It can be expressed as following equation:"
