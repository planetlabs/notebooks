    "This tutorial is an introduction to [Planet's](https://www.planet.com) Destination API using the official [Python client](https://github.com/planetlabs/planet-client-python), the `Planet` module. The Destination API allows you manage and securely store cloud storage bucket credentials as a 'Destination' for a product delivery on the Planet Platform. This can serve as an alternative to adding credentials to multiple workflows, for example, as the Destination can be set up once, and then referenced in different Order or Subscription requests.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "An account on the [Planet Platform](https://www.planet.com/account/) is required to access any of Planet's API's. If you are not logged in, you will be prompted to do so below in the *SDK Authentication* section.\n",

    "1. Prepare destination variables; mainly credentials and bucket name, with some other items depending on cloud storage provider.\n",

    "## <u>Destination Information</u>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Supported Cloud Storage Destinations:\n",
    "* Amazon S3\n",
    "    * Most other services that implement the S3 compatibility API\n",
    "* Google Cloud Storage\n",
    "* Microsoft Azure Blob Storage\n",
    "* Oracle Cloud Storage\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Destinations Limitations:\n",
    "* Each *organization* is provided a limitation of up to 50 Destinations, which will be both visible and usable by each individual within said organization.\n",
    "* The creator of a Destination is considered its *owner*, and, along with your organizational administrator, will be the only one allowed to modify a Destination.\n",
    "* All Destinations must have unique names.\n",
    "* All Destination API requests are rate limited to 3 requests per second.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Destination Credentials Information\n",
    "* Credentials used to create a Destination must have both `write` and `delete` permissions (the specific names of these permissions may vary).\n",
    "    * When a destination is created or updated, Planet verifies access by attempting to write and then delete a test file named `planetverify.txt`. \n",
    "    * If the permissions are correctly configured, this file will be removed immediately and will not appear in the storage bucket or container.\n",
    "    * If you ever see this file, your credentials may be lacking the `delete` permissions needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Credential Security\n",
    "* Destination credentials are treated as secrets which are encrypted at rest and in transit between Planet systems, accessed and decrypted only when strictly required, during a delivery.\n",
    "* Destinations API will always redact these secrets in its responses.\n",
    "    * You can update credentials via the Destination API, but never read them using it.\n"
