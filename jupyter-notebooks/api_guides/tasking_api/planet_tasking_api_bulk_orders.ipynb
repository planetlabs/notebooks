Once the initial POST request has been made it is then possible to make subsequent calls to be informed of the status of the request and the various orders that comprised the payload that are to be created. A bulk tasking order can be comprised of up to 1000 tasking orders of any kind that are supported by the Tasking service. \n",

Of course feel free to change this to suit your needs but if you do take note that all times should be in UTC format. The start and end times are optional,but we include them in this tutorial to provide a better picture of what can be done."
