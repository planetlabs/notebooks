    "This tutorial is an introduction to [Planet's](https://www.planet.com) Features API using the official [Python client](https://github.com/planetlabs/planet-client-python), the `Planet` module. The Features API is used to create *Collections* made up of features that follow [OGC-compliant features standards](https://ogcapi.ogc.org/features/). The features are stored as GeoJson format FeatureCollections, and will be then be available to use across the Planet platform, including in Planet Explorer and Features Manager. The features within your feature collection are referred to as *items* within the FeatureCollection.\n",
