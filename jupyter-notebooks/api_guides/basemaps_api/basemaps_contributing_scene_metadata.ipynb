    "# Contributing scenes metadata for a region in a Planet Basemap\n",
    "\n",
    "This example demonstrates how to use the [Planet APIs](https://developers.planet.com/docs/apis/) to retrieve *contributing scene metadata* for an area of interest or region of a Planet basemap. Scene metadata includes geographic footprints as well as other information about the scene like the type of instrument, capture times, azimuth etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "[Planet Basemaps](https://www.planet.com/products/basemap/) are created by compositing and mosaicking individual scenes, and it's often useful to see which scenes were used to create the basemap. Basemap data is stored as a collection of \"quads\", geotiff files spanning a regular grid, and each [representation of a quad on the Basemaps API links](https://developers.planet.com/docs/basemaps/reference/#operation/getQuad) to information on which scenes were used in it's creation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the [Planet Basemaps API](https://developers.planet.com/docs/basemaps/) we can search for the quads that comprise a region in a particular basemap, and then use the [Planet Data API](https://developers.planet.com/docs/apis/data/) to retrieve the complete scene metadata that describes each scene present in each quad.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we use the [Python](https://www.python.org/) programming language with some basic packages like [requests](https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to help us interact with the Planet APIs to download the data we want, outputting our result as a [GeoJSON FeatureCollection](https://geojson.org/) whose features are each one of the contributing scenes to the region for the basemap. The scene metadata format can be see in [this response sample](https://developers.planet.com/docs/apis/data/reference/#operation/GetItem) from the Planet Data API. At the end of this notebook, we've combined the steps to create a small utility function that can be used to get contributing scenes metadata for a given basemap and region.\n",
    "\n",
    "Basemap quads and their contributing scene information can also be viewed in the [Planet Basemaps Viewer](https://www.planet.com/basemaps/) web application, although this script makes it easier to get data for many quads and larger regions."
