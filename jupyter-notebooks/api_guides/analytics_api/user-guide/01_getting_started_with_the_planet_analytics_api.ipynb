    "## 1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The Planet Analytics API leverages computer vision to transform Planet imagery into *analytic feeds* that detect and classify objects, identify geographic features, and monitor change over time across the globe. \n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial series corresponds with the Analytics Feeds [User Guide](https://developers.planet.com/docs/analytics/), and is intended to help developers access the Planet Analytics API in order to build applications and solutions on top of this unique dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "This installment of the tutorial series will focus on connecting to the API and serve as an overview of the concepts of **Feeds** and **Subscriptions**, the two basic building blocks of an \"analytics feed\".\n",
    "\n",
    "### Feeds \n",
    "A **Feed** represents an analytic derived from Planet imagery. Each feed essentially represents an analytic capability that has been uniquely configured to optimize performance and quality, and each have unique types of outputs. For example, a Road Detection Feed represents roads detected on monthly Planet Basemaps, and outputs raster \"segmentation mask\" data. Several types of Feeds are currently available on the Planet Analytics API, and we plan on releasing new feeds in the future.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Subscriptions \n",
    "Users have *subscriptions to feeds* in a specific Area of Interest (AOI) and Time Interval of Interest (TOI). For example, a **Subscription** could be Road Detections over 12 months in San Francisco, California. \"Subscribing\" to a Feed is how a user can initiate the process of leveraging an analytic capability over an AOI/TOI and generate analytics datasets called \"Results\".\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll be covering how to access the available Feeds and Subscriptions in this tutorial.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Results\n",
    "\n",
    "When new Planet imagery is published that intersects a Subscription's AOI and TOI, Planet’s computer vision models process the imagery and the output is added to a \"collection\" of **Results** associated with the Subscription. \n",
    "\n",
    "The next tutorial in this series will examine results in more detail.\n",
    "\n",
    "Visit us at [planet.com](https://www.planet.com/products/analytics/) to learn more about Planet's unique analytics capabilities and offerings."

    "The Planet Analytics API follows a RESTful (Representational State Transfer) API interface over HTTP:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### HTTP Basics\n",
    "\n",
    "Communicating with the Planet Analytics API is achieved via [Hypertext Transfer Protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol) (HTTP) by sending \"HTTP requests\" from a \"client\" (your computer or another server) to the Planet Analytics API server, which will issue \"responses\" back to the requester. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are many ways to make an HTTP request including command line programs such as [cURL](https://curl.haxx.se/) and libraries written for specific programming languages like [httplib](https://docs.python.org/2/library/httplib.html) in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "Requests can also be made from your favorite web browser, or other graphical user interfaces (GUI) such as [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/). We can even use [QGIS](https://www.qgis.org) to request our Planet Analytics API results.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "To facilitate ease-of-use and ensure quality and compliance for a wide variety of applications, the Planet Analytics API implements two standardized specifications: \n",
    "* OpenAPI\n",
    "* WFS 3.0\n",

    "The Planet Analytics API conforms to the **[OpenAPI Specfication](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification)**. \n",
    "\n",
    "> The OpenAPI Specification, formerly known as the Swagger Specification, is the world’s standard for defining RESTful interfaces. The OAS enables developers to design a technology-agnostic API interface that forms the basis of their API development and consumption.\n",
