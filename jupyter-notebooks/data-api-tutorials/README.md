## Using Python to access Planet's imagery

These guides are designed for users who want to learn how to programmatically access Planet's data archive. With just a few lines of Python, you can interact with Planet's [Data API](https://developers.planet.com/docs/apis/data/) to quick-search types of imagery, create filters based on target parameters, and activate and downland images and metadata. If you'd like to start with a visual exploration of Planet data over time, visit [Planet Explorer](https://www.planet.com/explorer/), and then circle back to these API-based guides. 

### Choose your own adventure
The first notebook uses the Python `requests` library and a few lines of helper code to explore the full functionality of the Data API. The second guide uses Planet's Python command-line interface to quickly step through a common workflow of searching, activating, and downloading imagery.
