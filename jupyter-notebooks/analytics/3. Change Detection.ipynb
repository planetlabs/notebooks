    "## 2. Change Detection Results\n",
    "\n",
    "The semantic change detection product has been built through the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 1 -**\n",
    "Develop a high performing road detection model and leverage it to extract roads from imagery\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 2 -**\n",
    "Run road detection over an AOI over an extended period of time, gathering as many data points as possible\n",
    "From month to month, variations in atmosphere, shadows and other factors cause very small differences in the outputs over time leading to significant noise or “flicker”\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 3 -**\n",
    "We de-noise the results by considering the temporal context of each pixel detected. This leads to a more consistent output, however it does introduce a “lag” in when we are able to detect change\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 4 -**\n",
    "We then compare the most recent de-noised output with the previous de-noised output, pull out the differences and polygonize them.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How do you define building and road construction?\n",
    "\n",
    "By buildings, we refer to any 3D man-made structure that is static and where a person could take shelter in. For example, this includes residential buildings, stadiums, warehouses and storage tanks. \n",
    "\n",
    "By roads, we mean any man-made path designed for cars to drive on. \n",
    "\n",
    "Our definition of construction is the transition of land into these man-made structures. It does not include reconstruction or modification of existing structures. For example, new stories added to a building will not be detected.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What does a change detection result represent?\n",
    "\n",
    "In the building construction feed, a change result contains a geographic polygon that represents the footprint of a contiguous area where we have detected building construction. \n",
    "Thus, these polygons represent general built-up area, and may not identify individual buildings. They may be a group of small buildings clumped together, or a new adjacent wing of an existing building.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the case of the road construction feed, the change results contain a linestring, instead of a polygon. This linestring represents the skeleton of a road segment that has been constructed. \n",
    "\n",
    "### When did the change actually occur?\n",
    "\n",
    "Building and road construction is typically detected 3-4 months after the event took place. Our system performs statistical inference on the time series of images at the pixel level, and issues a change detection once there is enough confidence that a true transition occurred. Since we use images from Planet Basemaps, which have a monthly sampling rate, we cannot determine the week or day of an event. \n"
