# Overview

These files are meant to be used in conjunction with the Jupyter Notebooks from thier respective API. They are interactive notebooks that can be used to check the users understanding throughout the training.

# Setup

Before a training with a customer make sure to upload the coresponding file to [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/). During the training you will be able to share the link and help guide them through the exercises.

## Data API

Run a basic statistics search and have the participants fill out the search criteria to their AOI and time period, using their API key. They will need to change the perameters of the Date, the location of the search and the cloud cover.

The second exercise has all the right commands but they must rearange them in order to show their understanding of the process. The second to last step can take a long time so ideally activate the imagery ahead of time so that the link appears immediately.
