    "# PS Orthotile and Landsat 8 Crossovers\n",
    "\n",
    "Have you ever wanted to compare PS images to Landsat 8 images? Both image collections are made available via the Planet API. However, it takes a bit of work to identify crossovers - that is, images of the same area that were collected within a reasonable time difference of each other. Also, you may be interested in filtering out some imagery, e.g. cloudy images.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook walks you through the process of finding crossovers between PS Orthotiles and Landsat 8 scenes. In this notebook, we specify 'crossovers' as images that have been taken within 1hr of eachother. This time gap is sufficiently small that we expect the atmospheric conditions won't change much (this assumption doesn't always hold, but is the best we can do for now). We also filter out cloudy images and constrain our search to images collected in 2017, January 1 through August 23."
